run `yarn start`

### troubleshooting

1. my css doesn't format on save.

    Try installing vs code extension "beautify", running "Format Document" from the command palette (cmd+x). A popup might appear on the bottom saying you need to select which one, click that and select "Prettier". Otherwise you might want to go into Preferences>Settings and turn off eslint formatting, and turn on prettier formatting, and trying the flow again. This sucks and took me a while to debug. # consensys-nft-project
